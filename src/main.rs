output:

This program prints out the KWIC index of a text from a txt file
But the KWIC is not aligned nor Alphabetical

    let f_name = "src\\Text.txt";

    // read it and convert to string
    let file = (fs::read_to_string(f_name).expect("Couldn't read file")).to_string();
    // We read file successfully üëè

    // Now lets split the file by each new lines
    let lines = file.lines();
    // Basically cloning for later
    let l_a = file.lines();

    // Iterate through every line in the text
    for i in lines {

            // Every word is a String
            let mut word = a.to_string();

            // I stop words contain that word
            if stop_words.contains(&a) {

                // Then convert it to lowercase
                word = a.to_lowercase();

            } else {

            }
            // we append the word in to a vector
            m.push(word);
        }

    // Printing the result
    // Making a var index for finding where the line ends
    let mut index = 0;

    // For i in every line in text
    for i in l_a {

        // sne is basically splitting every line

            // We print the word from Vector m at index "index"
            print!("{} ",m[index]);
            index+=1;

            // now we check if the word is the last word in sentence
            if a == las_word[las_word.len()-1] {
